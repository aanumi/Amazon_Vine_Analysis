# AMAZON_VINE WRITTEN ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to determine and analyze Amazon reviews written by users on Vine. The Amazon vine program is a program that allows manufacturers receive reviews for their products. Vine users use the product, and in turn write and publish their reviews. This analysis aims to determine the results of the analyzed data to examine biases depending on whether or not one is a vine member. 


## RESULTS

A summary of the results is listed below, with images to follow:

	•	Paid vine reviews = 136 
 	•	Paid 5-star vine reviews = 74
 	•	Percentage of paid 5-star vine reviews = 54.41%
 	•	Unpaid vine reviews = 17999 
 	•	Unpaid 5-star vine reviews = 8480
 	•	Percentage of unpaid 5-star vine reviews = 47.11%

As seen in the image below, the total number of paid vine reviews is 136, the total number of paid 5-star reviews is 74, and the percentage of 5-star reviews from paid vine users is 54.14%

## SUMMARY
From the results discussed above, there seems to be no significant positivity bias from the category of paid vine user reviews that significantly affects the program. Even though we have 54% 5-star reviews from paid vine reviews as compared to 47% 5-star reviews from unpaid vine reviews, the pool of the paid vine users is too small to regard 54% as positivity bias. It is a little tricky to determine bias with this small of a margin. If the percentage of the paid 5-star vine reviewers were higher, say at about 69% and above, it could present a more accurate picture of bias in the program.


One additional analysis that could be done to paint a more accurate picture of bias would be to analyze paid & unpaid vine user reviews from additional datasets. This could set a precedent by establishing a clear pattern of bias or no bias for paid users vs non-paid users.
